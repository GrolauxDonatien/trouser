        // JavaScriptLive has not particular support for components.
        // However, live variables offer a generic mechanism which can be used as a replacement for APIs.
        // By capturing the evolving states of components into one or more live variables,
        // the manipulation of the component is reduced to the manipulation of live variables.
        // Furthermore, components can also directly use live entities to benefit from their properties.

            // This function creates a component, however instead of returning an API, it returns a live object.
            // This live object stores the keys and the items in the todo list.
            let list = live({});
            // Internally, we will use mapChildren to configure the DOM according to list.
            // However, mapChildren requires a live array to work on, not an object.
            // This is for optimization purposes: mapChildren will not render every children for each update, 
            // just those that are changed in the live array.
            // Fortunately, it is easy to convert the live object keys to a live array using a live function.

            // there exists restrictions on what they can do: some functions are safe to use as live functions,
            // while others are not. A live function should only have closures on live entities. 
            // For each such closure, either the function access the live entity, or mutates it,
            // but not both. In other words, live functions are safe as long as they create forward mutations 
            // from one set of live entities to a distinct different set of live entities.
